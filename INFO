Description: Species Level Identification of Microbes from Metagenomes.
 SLIMM: Investigates which microbial species are present from a BAM/SAM
  alignment file(s). Given an alignment of metagenomic reads to a list
  of microbial reference genomes SLIMM produces a taxonomic profile that
  contains the relative abundance of different  microbial species or
  lower clades present in the sample from where the reads are sequenced
  from.
