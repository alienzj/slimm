SLIMM - Species Level Identification of Microbes from Metagenomes - 
=================================================================

a taxonomic profiling tool that investigates which microorganisms are present in a sequenced sample. SLIMM requires a BAM/SAM alignment file as an input. One can use a read mapper of choice to map raw reads obtained from a sequencing machine to obtain the BAM/SAM file required as input for SLIMM.
